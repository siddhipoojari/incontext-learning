# incontext-learning
This repository documents my project that explores the in-context learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), specifically focusing on procedural and creative writing tasks using ChatGPT, Claude.ai, and Google Bard. The project evaluates how well these models can generate coherent and relevant content based on structured prompts.
